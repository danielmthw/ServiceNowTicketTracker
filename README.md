# Service-Now-Ticket-Tracker
Ticket Tracker App is a lightweight desktop app built to help IT staff stay on top of their ServiceNow ticket submissions — because we’ve all done the work, but forgot to put in the ticket.  This app solves this by giving you a quick-entry form, visual checklist, and reminder alerts — helping you log what you did while it's fresh.
